        BCRD Master Wallet Trade Flow

            Actors
                     Master BCRD Wallet: Holds all BCRD ledger for payouts.
                     Master BNB Wallet: Holds BNB liquidity and collects fees.
                     User Wallet: Executes trades and receives PNL in BCRD.




            Step-by-Step Trade Flow

               Step 1: User closes trade with a PNL of 60 BCRD.
               User calls closeTrade() on the smart contract.


               Step 2: Master BCRD temporarily lends 60 BCRD to the user.


               Step 3: Trade executes against Master BNB Wallet.
               Example swap: 60 BCRD → 0.67 BNB.
               Maker and Taker fees (in BNB) are applied and posted to Master BNB Wallet.


               Step 4: BNB from trade (0.67 BNB) is returned to Master BNB Wallet.


               Step 5: 60 BCRD PNL is credited to the user’s BCRD balance in the contract.

            Key Notes
                      BNB fees (maker/taker) are collected on-chain and sent to Master BNB
                      Wallet.
                      BCRD PNL is lent from Master BCRD and delivered to user on trade close.
                      All balances, PNL, and fees are recorded on-chain for auditing.
                      No external routers; all swaps are simulated internally in the contract.
